PredictionIO


PredictionIO is an open source Machine Learning Server for developers and data scientists to build and deploy predictive engines.


consists of 
1.PredictionIO Platform
2.Event server
3.Template Gallery

In a common scenario, PredictionIO's Event Server continuously collects data from your application. A PredictionIO engine then builds predictive model(s) with one or more algorithms using the data. After it is deployed as a web service, it listens to queries from your application and respond with predicted results in real-time.


Event Server

It serves two purposes:

Provide data to Engine(s) for model training and evaluation
Offer a unified view for data analysis


Engine

Engine is responsible for making prediction. It contains one or more machine learning algorithms. An engine reads training data and build predictive model(s). It is then deployed as a web service. A deployed engine responds to prediction queries from your application through REST API in real-time.

PredictionIO's template gallery offers Engine Templates for all kinds of machine learning tasks. You can easily create one or more engines from these templates .

The components of a template, namely Data Source, Data Preparator, Algorithm(s), and Serving, are all customizable for your specific needs.
